Sample application using the FlambeWebSocket system from https://github.com/creativedrewy/FlambeWebSocket, which was also used as base for client and server.

# What it does

Will simply display a starry mouse trail for each connected user. There are four different types of stars that will be cycled through for each user that connect.
This is achived with a node.js websocket server, and a Flambe client published to both Flash and HTML5.
